# ELEC 391 - Power Tracking GUI
Python script that generates a GUI using input data from a serial port and plots said data in two different graphs: a time-voltage graph and a voltage-power graph.

This script uses the Tkinter library to create a simple GUI whose purpose is to display data in real time. Interactions with the serial port are handled by the pySerial library and the graphing is done using the Matplotlib library.
